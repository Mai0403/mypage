          <li><strong>Back-end web developers</strong> create the website’s structure, write code, and verify the code works.
            Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a website’s content.</li>
          <li><strong>Front-end web developers</strong>work on the visual part of the website—the pages visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). 
            They design the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site. 
            You can gain essential front-end web development skills with Meta's Front-End Developer Professional Certificate.</li>
          <li><strong>Full-stack developers</strong>do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete 
            website and may work for organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team. 
            If you're interested in full-stack web development, consider earning IBM's Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate.</li>
          <li><strong>Webmasters</strong> are essentially website managers. Their primary responsibility is to keep the website updated,

  <p>
    During the last few years, I have done a really interesting project called the smart IoT garden, 
    it is about creating a better way to take care of the garden through using AI. We had developed the sensor 
    to detect the soil, whenever the soil is not moisture enough the sensor will automatically pure the water to the soil 
    without people checking up. <br>There is more sensor that helps to take care of the plant such as the sunlight sensor and weather sensor.
     The other project that I have done was the worm farm and stop motion which is about science and technology. 
     These three projects had represented our school to join the National STEM fair 2019.
